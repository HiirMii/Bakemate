# Baking App Project
Second Project for Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree by Google.

The goal of this project was to build the baking app that allows user to browse through baking recipes.
Every recipe contains a list of ingredients and a list of preparation steps.
Clicking on a step opens a screen with a description and optional video showing what has to be done in the specific step.
There is also a widget associated with the app that displays ingredients list for the currently viewed recipe.
